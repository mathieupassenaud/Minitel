Revision history for Net-Twitter

2.12 - Wed Mar 25, 2009
	o Removed test that uses show_progress arg to LWP::UserAgent, as this did not
		exist until v5.815.
	o Because of the above require LWP::UA of at least v2.032, as the two remaining 
		tests are OK with that version.

2.11 - Thu Mar 19, 2009
	o Added useragent_args to new() to allow passing args to the LWP::UA object
	o Added test for above
	o Removed POD about dependancies. 

2.10 - Thu Feb 26, 2009
	o Fix https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43658 which proves I'm an idiot. 
		The SYNOPSIS fix in 2.08 doesn't match up with reality. Passing args to 
		new() with {} would break. This is now fixed.

2.09 - Thu Feb 20, 2009
	o Embarrassing. Since the very first 2.xx update_profile has been missing. This 
		adds it back in and tests it.
	
2.08 - Thu Feb 19, 2009
	o Fixed ridiculously broken logic in get_error JSON deparse.
	o POD fix with SYNOPSIS to make the examples match the {} requirement
	
2.07 - Thu Feb 12, 2009
	o Add new friends_ids and followers_ids social graph methods
	o Added tests for the above.
	o Fix bug where get_error was not decoding the JSON that was returned.
	o Added documentation about hashref passing needing {} specified.
	
2.06 - Mon Jan 26, 2009
	o 2.05 had glitch which caused some methods like user_timeline to call the 
		incorrect URL when called with no args, returning the wrong user's 
		timeline.
	o Added test to prevent the above.
	o Added Net::Twitter::Search, as I now have permissions.
	o Added distribution of the local test that checks all arg combos.
	
2.05 - Sun Jan 25, 2009
	o public_timeline can now take zero args.
	o Any method which can take "id" as the only arg in the passed hashref can now also take that arg
		value as a string.
	o More arg validation updates. We're running out of places to break, knock on wood.
	o Code run through local test not packaged with the module which tests each method with every
		conceivable combination of args. There should be no more places the arg validation breaks
		valid arg combos, and it should be much more difficult for me to break it so in the future.

2.04 - Sat Jan 24, 2009
	o More tweaks from Marc Mims on regression tests
	o Reworked bad arg handling which caused subsequent calls of several methods to fail.
	o Fixed issue with arg handling in show_status
	o Removed Net::Twitter::Search until I can get assistance from Brenda, CPAN complains that I don't have
		rights to the namespace and people are reporting problems finding 2.x because the index is off.
	o Switch to using Module::Install

2.03 - Thu Jan 22, 2009
	o Bad MANIFEST kept the regression tests out of the 2.02 distribution.
	o Change clienturl to default to http://www.net-twitter.info and removed pointless XML warning.
	
2.02 - Thu Jan 22, 2009
	o Add arrayref_on_error switch at the suggestion of Ryan Rose. Changes default return value on error.
	o Added regression test suite by Marc Mims, hopefully no more crappy releases missing things.
	o Fixed several bugs in arg handling and validation to make it work correctly. Should now be 100%

2.01 - Fri Jan 16, 2009
	o Add back in the inexplicably missing update_twittervision
	o Fixed several errors with methods that can take a single arg, not a hashref. This has to happen
		for back compat with 1.xx
	o Patch from semifor to fix args handling on GET methods. It worked but was semantically wrong.
	
2.00 - Thu Jan 15, 2009
	o Final release including all of the below.
	o Differences since 2.00_05
		o Added Net::Twitter::Search stub file to act as a wrapper.
		o Added clone() method
		o More POD cleanup.
		o Switched from die/warn to Carp::carp/croak

2.00_05 - Mon Jan 12, 2009
	o 2.00_04 had a glaring error that prevented anything that used an HTTP POST, 
		like update(), from actually, you know, POSTing.
	o Great suggestion from semifor on passing form values to LWP::UserAgent replaced 34 lines of
		ridiculous arg handling with 3 lines and a call to URI. Much better.
	o Yet more POD and minor tweaks.

2.00_04 - Sat Jan 10, 2009
	o Remove result hack for relationship_exists as twitter has fixed their end.
	o Completely rework arg validation to allow calling with no args, yet trapping 
		where this is wrong.
	o Add JSON eval trapping to regular methods, it was mistakenly only 
		happening on search.
	o Massive POD rewrites to clarify and expand, and even correct a few mistakes.
	
2.00_03 - Fri Jan 9, 2009
	o Add Net::Identica which wraps a Net::Twitter object and sets the default connection to identi.ca
	o Fix show_user argument handling which was broken to this point
	o Add full search API
	o Trap errors in JSON decoding when Twitter returns a 200 Success, preventing JSON::Any from die-ing
	o Various POD fixes and updates
	
2.00_02 - Wed Jan 7, 2009
	o Applied http://github.com/semifor/net-twitter/commit/34b042f653d3c9c39f0003504070b4014da7d854
	o Applied logic from patch to 1.xx by Chris Nelson to prevent bad JSON from 
		causing JSON::Any to die. JSON errors should now gracefully return undef.
	o POD change, spurious h in the URL for rt.cpan.org
	o Updated copyright to 2009
	o Add IRC and other contact info.

2.00_01 - Mon Dec 22, 2008
	o From scratch redo. All the old code is gone and replaced with new.
	o Changes against 1.xx include:
		o identica quick switch to new() to set identi.ca connect info
		o Full arg validation. This can be bypassed.
		o All methods are now generated dynamically from a lookup 
		  table at runtime.
